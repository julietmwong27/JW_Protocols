# Standard protocol for use of the FIU MSB autoclave

Original: 20200210   
Last Revised: 20200210

This protocol is for use of the autoclave found on the 1st floor of the MSB building. It has been modified using instructions from the Bracken-Grissom Lab.

    - 	latex or nitrile gloves
    -  autoclave indicator tape 
    - 	aluminum foil
    - 	secondary containment if autoclaving liquids
    -  heat-resistant cloves

2. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**
	* **Verify that all materials you are preparing are autoclavable!** If you are unsure, check the product numbers and look up the specifications.
	* Remove any previously used autoclave tape
	* When preparing materials to autoclave, wear latex or nitrile gloves
	* Preparing materials to autoclave (dry)
		* For closed containers, always make sure that the cap or lid is losely screwed on. **Never autoclave a container that is sealed closed.** Place a piece of autoclave tape running from the lid to the top part of the container (so that the tape will need to be torn when the container is opened for the first time after autoclaving). [example before autoclaving](https://github.com/julietmwong27/JW_Protocols/blob/master/Autoclave%20images/autoclave_bottle_before.JPG) [example after autoclaving](https://github.com/julietmwong27/JW_Protocols/blob/master/Autoclave%20images/autoclave_bottle_after.JPG)
		* For open containers, place a piece of aluminum foil over the opening (e.g., the top of a beaker or flask). Place a piece of autoclave tape on the foil.
		* For autoclavable pipet tip boxes, place a piece of autoclave tape running from the lid to the side of the box (so that the tape will need to be cut to open the box for the first time after autoclaving)
		* For autoclaving small items (e.g., microcentrifuge tubes), place them in an empty beaker or other open autoclavable container, cover the opening with aluminum foil, and place a piece of autoclave tape on the foil. [example before autoclaving](https://github.com/julietmwong27/JW_Protocols/blob/master/Autoclave%20images/autoclave_tubes_before.JPG) [example after autoclaving](https://github.com/julietmwong27/JW_Protocols/blob/master/Autoclave%20images/autoclave_tubes_after.JPG)
	* Preparing materials to autoclave (liquid)
		* Verify that the liquid can autoclaved. Seawater is okay for the MSB autoclave (although that is not always true for all autoclaves). Acids, bases, organic solvents, chlorides, sulphates, and bleach are generally **NOT** autoclavable.
		* Only use containers that are properly vented (e.g., the cap is loosely screwed on). 
		* Never fill more than 2/3 full. Secondary containment is ideal.
		* Place a piece of autoclave tape on the container
	* Using the autoclave
		* Make sure the output hose is firmly in the sink. The end of the hose should rest against the bottom of the drain. **Please confirm this before starting the autoclave.**
		* Turn on the autoclave using the switch on the bottom right-hand corner of the machine. Then use the power button on the display panel.
		* The door should be open. Load everything, make sure nothing is touching the inside of the autoclave. Tip boxes can be stacked and tightly packed as long as the autoclave tape indicates autoclaving has occurred at the end of the run.
		* Hold the door closed. The machine should “grab” the door and secure it.
		* Select the protocol. 
			* For dry materials, hit PROGR and scroll to 1 – Instruments. Set the protocol by hitting PROGR again. At the main screen, select PARAM to confirm the program reaches 121 C for 20 min and has a 10 min dry time. Return to main screen.
			* For liquids, scroll to 8 – Liquids. Set the protocol by hitting PROGR again. At the main screen, select PARAM to confirm the program reaches 121 C for 15 min and has a 0 min dry time. There should be no dry time for liquids. Return to main screen.
		* The main screen should now display “ready” under ‘STOP key = Open’. If ‘Ready’ is not displayed, try opening and closing the door again. This may require turning the machine off and on again.
		* Once the main screen displays ‘Ready’ and the protocol is set, hit START.
		* **Input the code, 1000**, by pressing the up-bottom once, then PROGR. The autoclave will begin running.
		* In 60-90 min, the protocol will be complete. Return to the machine, press STOP, and the door will open. 
		* At this point, verify that everything has been autoclaved by checking the indicator tape. **The lines on the tape should have turned from green to black.**
		* Unload the autoclave using heat-resistant gloves and leave the door open (this allows the machine to dry out completely between uses).
		* Turn the machine off using the switch on the bottom right-hand corner of the machine. 
		* If there are any technical issues with the autoclave, contact Bill Chamberlain.
