# Standard protocol for Total RNA Extractions from sea urchins 

Original: 20200217
Last Revised: 20200217 

This protocol has been modified following the manufacturer's instructions for use of [TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen)](http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf).
It has been optimized for total RNA extractions from sea urchin eggs, embryos, and larvae. This has specifically been tested on ~5000 pooled eggs, embryos, or larvae per sample for purple urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) and red urchins (*Mesocentrotus franciscanus*).

2. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**
	1. Clean benchtop and pipets by wiping them down with:
		* 	Bleach
		*  Water
		*  Ethanol
		*  RNAseZap
	2. Homogenize samples
		* **Only homogenize 2-4 samples from the freezer at a time. This minimizes the opportunity for RNA degradation.**
		* Remove samples from the freezer and place them on ice. Immediately add **500uL of cold TRIzol** to each sample.
		* Homogenize the sample in TRIzol by passing the entire sample three times through decreasing sizes of needles (21-gauge, 23 gauge, and then 25-gauge). 
	1. Isolate RNA
		* 	Let samples stand for **5 minutes at room temperature
**		*  Centrifuge at 12,000g for **10 min at 4 deg C**
		*  Remove and save supernatant in a clean, labeled 1.5mL tube. Discard pellet. Add **100uL of chloroform** to the supernatant.
		*  Invert rapidly for 15 seconds and let stand for 2-3 minutes at room temperature
		*  Centrifuge at 12,000g for **15 min at 4 deg C**
		*  Using a p200, carefully pipet off the ~250uL aqueous fraction and transfer it to a clean 1.5mL tube. 
	1. Precipitate RNA
		* 	Add **250 uL of isopropanol** and invert 3Xs
		*  Precipitate in -20 deg C for 1 hr, or *OPTIONAL* precipitate in -20 dec F overnight
	1. Wash
		* 	Let stand at **room temperature for 10 min**, then centrifuge at 12,000g for **15 min at 4 dec C**
		*  Carefully discard supernatant using a pipet. A pellet should be visible. Take care not to accidentally pipet up the pellet.
		*  Wash the pellet in **250uL of ice cold ethanol**. Dislodge the pellet by dragging it across a tube rack. This should wash both sides of the pellet.
		*  Centrifuge at 12,000g for **5 min at 4 deg C**
		*  **Repeat wash**
	1. Resuspension
		* Carefully discard all the ethanol using a pipet. Allow the pellet to air dry ~10 minutes, but don't leave it for too long on the bench. Move rapidly to the next step after drying.
		* Resuspend pellet in RNAse free water. The volume will vary, but 25uL is a good starting guess.
	1. 	QC 
		* Nanodrop samples. 260/280 = 1.8-2.0, 260/230 > 1.8
		* Quantify samples (Qubit)
		* Check RIN values using TapeStation or Bioanalyzer, RIN > 8.0
		* Store RNA frozen at -80 deg C
